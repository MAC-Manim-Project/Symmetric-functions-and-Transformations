The area of a circle is \pi r^2.
Here, Area is a "function" of r.
Input any r to this function and it gives you the area.

Functions can be thought of as machines. Give them inputs and they give you outputs.
Functions do have restrictions on what they can give you. (The vertical line test)

Domain and range. (Brief. More later)

The book mentions the 4 Ways to represent a function.
With words , By explicit formula (Algebraically) , With a graph , With a table (Numerically)
Depending on what we want to do, one representation might be better than the others

Graphing.
To graph functions with one input and one output (2d functions) we first draw a 2d coordinate system.
Commonly, the horizontal axis is where choose the inputs from. (The r axis in A = \pi r^2)
For that r (the input) calculate area (the output) and plot the point (r,A).
As you choose different input, you might get different output.

In this video, we'll talk about symmetry and transformation of functions. Before getting into it, let's recall how we graph a function. Take a function like this: [f(x)= x^3 - 3x], to make the graph, we can first choose some x in the domain as our input. I choose -1. And For that x, we calculate the output which is f(-1). That's just evaluating the function at that x. And that turns out to be 2. That means, if the input is -1, the output is 2. Now we plot the point (-1 , f(-1)). But a single point is not the graph. If we repeat this for all x-values in the domain, plotting that (x,f(x)) each time, we get the full graph of the function. In this animation, I only used x's between -2.5 to 2.5 because the other xs give points off-screen. For a complete graph, these lines will continue forever. Okay, Now let's get into the main topics of this video. And first of them is: Symmetry. Mathematically, symmetry is a property of an object. The property of being unchanged after a transformation. Let's look at this triangle. One of the symmetries of this triangle is it is symmertic under the reflection about this line. It means if you "reflect" the triangle about this line, it looks the same as the original. Reflection about this line is one of the _transformations, that leaves the triangle unchanged. The triangle is also symmetric under the reflection about this line. And it's also symmetric under this reflection. This triangle is symmetric for even transformations other than reflection. Like a 120 degrees rotation about the center. In fact, _these are all of the symmetries of this triangle [while editing, play once forward and once reverse]. And Yes I have also listed the zero degrees rotation, that's the action of doing nothing which also leaves the triangle unchanged. It actually has a fancy name, it's called the identity element of this set of actions. Okay, that was a small introduction to symmetry, Now looking back at this graph, is it symmetric in any way? [Pause] And the answer is yes. It is symmetric under a 180 degrees rotation about the origin. The graph looks the same, or is _unchanged after this action _or the transformed graph perfectly coincides with the original graph. We call this type of function odd function. Here is a proper definition of an odd function: A function is an odd function, if the graph of that function is symmetric under a 180 degrees rotation about the origin. Again, by symmetric, I mean the transformed graph looks the same as the original graph. There are also even functions. A function is an even function, if the graph of that function is symmetric under a reflection about the Y-axis. If we apply this transformation to this graph, it does not coincide with the original, so, it's not an even function. And it turns out these two symmetries are particularly more useful to talk about for a function, more than other symmetries. Let's look at some graphs and identify them as even or odd functions. Here's our graph, to see if this is an odd function, we just rotate the graph 180 degrees. It's not the same graph after that, so not odd. If we reflect about the y-axis, it perfectly coincides. So, it is an even function. Here are some more examples without me talking. [don't show equations just graphs. y=x^2 , y = |x|/x , y = (x^4)/2-2x^2 + x -1 , sin(x) , y = 0, floor(x)] [for each graph, have an original and a ghost, transform the original both ways. If not symmetric flip it and try next one.] Okay, now you can tell if a function is even or odd by looking at its graph. But what if you don't have a graph of the function, just the equation, well, there is a way. I mean there are 2 ways really, first is to just make the graph and then and then do the transformations. Here is the next way. To see if a function is an odd function [f(x) = x^3 - x], let's say we want to see if the given function on the screen is an odd function, we find f of negative x. Just replace all of the x's with negative x. And if that turns out to be the same as negative f of x, like it does in this case, it is an odd function. And this works for any function not just this one. If f of -x is negative f of x, then it's an odd function. But for some other example function if you find f of negative x [f(x) = x^4 - 2x^2 + 1] and it turns out to be the original f of x, it is an even function. So, I'll repeat this one more time, if you have a function, it is an odd function if f of negative x is equal to negative f of x. To find f of negative x, you just replace all of the x's in the function with a negative x and see what happens. and similarly, It is an even function if f of negative x is equal to f of x. If f of negative x is neither of those, then it's neither odd nor even. Now you've seen the two ways to ckeck if the function is even or odd, the graphical way and the algebraic way. try to argue that both ways are in fact the same way. Okay, now that we’ve talked about symmetry, let’s talk more generally about how a function’s graph can transform. If you have an equation of a function, you can add or change some parts of the equation, sometimes the graph of the function changes predictibly. There are 3 main types of function transformations. Translation, or shifting [visually translate a graph], stretching or compressing and reflecting. Let's go over each of them. If you have a function, [f(x) = x^2/3] remember what its graph means. It is the collection of the points [choose a random point, fade in] x [draw a line from y axis to the point] comma f of x [draw a line from x axis] for each x in the domain. Knowing this is very important if you want to understand the transformations. For any x, the output of the funcntions is the height of the point. Okay, so, Now if we define a new function, g of x = f of x - 2, think what the new graph is going to look like. First, the domain is the same. For an input to the function g, it just gives that input to the function f and gets the output and subtracts 2 from it and gives the new output. So, for every x, the height of the new point is just 2 units below the original curve. Which has the effect of looking like the graph has been shifted down 2 units. Say you added a 1 instead. Still the same thing, for each x, function f would give you some output, but the g gives you one more than that. So the whole graph is shifted up by one unit. So, if you know what the graph of a function looks like, adding a constant at the end of the definition, just shifts the graph vertically by 'a' units. Up if a is positive and down if a is negative. You can also shift a graph horizontally. Take a look at this definition of g [g(x) = f(x-1)]. This time, f and g give the same outputs but for different inputs. Okay, g is defined like this and you wanna graph g. So, you pick some x and try to find the output. What g does is it subtracts 1 from its input and gives that as the input for f. So g got this input but f got this. So, f gives you back this height. But g says that height is my output but for this input instead. So to get the output of g you just slide the output of f 1 unit to the right. And if you do that for all of the x's The new graph just looks like the original just shifted to the right by 1 unit. And if we had f of x + 1 instead, the graph would shift to the left. So, if you have a function [f(x) = x^2] and define a new function like this, it just shifts the graph horizontally. Right if a is negative and left if a is positive. And you can also combine the horizontal and vertical shifts to move the graph anywhere. So, for practice, if I have this function [f(x) = -x^2] which is a parabola, and its vertex is at the origin, how should I define a new function such that the vertex moves over to the point (2 , 3)? Let's call the new function g of x. Now what I want to do is shift it right by 2 units and up by 3 units. So, to shift it right, I can do this, f of x minus 2, because remember if we subtract, it is a shift to the right. And now to shift up by 3 units, we can add 3 at the end of this modified function. Now this is a valid solution but g depends on f, so we can copy the definition of f inside g. And this would be a more compact solution. Now, onto stretching and compressing the graph. This can also happen both vertically and horizontally. But let's look at the vertical one first. Say we have a function f of x and its graph. And we define a new function g of x like this, 2 times f of x. And Just like before if g gets an input, it just gives that input to f and then it multiplies the output by 2 and gives that as its output. And because the output is the height, every point in the original curve just moves to twice its height. Any point in the x axis has the height 0 so those points do not move after the transformation. So this has the effect of stretching the graph by a factor of 2. And generally, if you have some a here, it would stretch by a factor of a. But if a is less than 1, say 0.5, then the graph is sqeezed or compressed by a factor 2. Because 0.5 is 1 over 2. You can think of it this, if you are multiplying by a constant, then the graph is stretched by that constant factor and if you are dividing by a constant, then the graph is compressed by that constant factor. But what if you multiply by a negative number. And g of x is negative 2 times f of x. Let's see what happens to a random input. We give this x to g so first we get this output from f. Then its multiplied by negative 2x. Which is like first scaling by a factor of 2 and flipping it to the other side. And if you do that for all x's, it looks like the graph is flipped and then stretched by a factor of 2. Multiplying by just negative 1 or just negative f of x is the flipped version of f of x without any stretching. And multiplying by a number other than negative 1 just flips it first and then does the stretching and compressing. Like if you had -1 over 2, it first flips it and then compresses by a factor of 2. And all that is just in the vertical direction. We can also stretch the graph in the horizontal direction. Let's define g like this [g(x) = f(3x)] and see what happens. So to graph g, you pick some x. This time what g does, is it scales the input by a factor of 3 and then gives that to f. So the output of g here is it output of f here. And that's true for all of the x's. So you can see, this has the effect of shrinking the graph horizontally by a factor of 3. So multiplying actually shrinks the graph. And remember, any points in the on the y-axis will stay at the same place. And dividing does the opposite. It stretches the graph. [animate no speaking] And if you multiply by a negative number, its the same here too. First it flips in the horizontal direction and then does the stretching or compressing part. This is an even function, so the flipped looks like the original. Let's look at an asymmetric one. [f(x) = 1.467x ln(|0.25894x|)2^-0.37493x ] Multiplying by negative 1 over 2 first flips it and then stretches it by a factor of 2. Aaand that's it for the transformations. That was a lot. So, let's recap. If you have a function and its graph, and you define a new function like this:[g(x) = af(bx+c)+d] where a,b,c and d are any constants. Based on these constants, the graph of g is gonna be some transformed version of graph of f. It can be shifted or stretched or squeezed or flipped in one of the axies or any combination of those transformations. Let me show you. Right now, the graph of g is on top of because the constants are not changing anything. But if I change d, the graph moves up. If d is negative, the graph moves down and it moves exactly by d units. If I change c, it moves in the horizontal direction. So, if we want to shift the graph, we change the values of c and d. But if we change a, the graph is stretched. And it is stretched by a factor of a. Meaning the new y-value of every point in the new graph is y-value of the old graph times a. If a is less than 1, the graph is compressed instead. You can still say it is stretched by a factor of a or you can say it is compressed by a factor of 1 over a. If a is zero, it is squeezed infinitely into a line but if a is negative, the graph first gets flipped and then gets stretched by a factor of the absolute value of a. Changing b, makes it compressed in the horizontal direction. The graph is compressed by a factor of b. Meaning the x-value of the new point is the x value of the original point divided by b. If b is less than 1, it is stretched by a factor of 1 over b. Aand that's how a,b,c and d affect the graph individually. But, what if they are all present at the same time. Like this: [a = 1.5 , b = 2 , c = 5 , d = -1]. And when it is a combination of everything, things are kind of unintuitive. Let me ask you a question, among these constants, a,b,c and d which one do you think acts on the graph first? I mean you know what a,b,c and d do individually, a stretches in the vertical direction, b compresses in the horizontal direction, c shifts in the horizontal direction and d shifts in the vertical direction. But together, which one does its thing first. And its a meaningful question, first stretching and shifting is different than first shifting then stretching. You might think 'b' acts first. The compression in the horizontal direction. Because, when you give an input to g, it is first multiplied by b then added to c and that is then passed to f and the output is multiplied by a then added to d. So you might think the order is first b then c then a and finally d. And that's slightly incorrect. When I was learning about this for the first time, I was making the same mistake. But then I thought it through and found ot the right order. But here, i'll just tell you the what without the why. So, turns out, 'c' acts first then b and the rest is the same as predicted, a then d. So, let's find what the transformed graph looks like. First it is shifted to the left by 5 units. because c is positive 5. So now this valley at x equals 1 is now at x equals negative 4. Now, b compresses the shifted graph horizontally by a factor of 2. All points in the graph that were x,y are now at x divided 2 , y. The valley is now at x equals - 2. And this is not the same graph as first compressing and shifting. Okay, Now, the graph is stretched vertically by a factor of 1.5 and then shifted down 1 unit. So this is the final transformed graph. Let's do a few practice problems. Here is the first one: [Given the following function: f(x) = x^2 and its graph, what would be the graph of this function g(x) = -(x-2^2 - 1)]. So, what we do first is write g in terms of f. In g, we have the quantity x - 2 squared. And we have f which squares things. So this can become f of x - 2. Now we can compare this to this. Which says a = -1, b = 1 , c = negative 2 and d equals -1. We said c acts first. So we shift it to the right by 2 units. Then b which says compress in the horizontal direction but compress by a factor of 1 does nothing. Then a is negative 1 that only flips the graph vertically and it doesnot stretch because the absolute value is 1. And finally d which shifts down 1 unit. And that's it. Let's do one more: [f(x) = e^x g(x) = 1/e^{2x-1} - 1] So, we want to write g in terms of f. And f of some number is e raised to that number. So if we have e raised to something, we can write that in terms of f. So we can write g like this: [1/f(2x+1) - 1]. Now g is in terms of f but this is not something we've been working with. We don't really know how this works. So, this didn't work. But we can write g like this:[e ^ -{2x+1} - 1]. Which we can write using f like this: [f(-(2x+1))-1] But we can't really compare this with our "standard" form. But distributing the negative makes it something we can work with. From here, we get a = 1, b = -2 , c = -1 and d = -1. And we know what all of them do and in what order. c  does its thing first, shifting to the right by 1 unit. And remember, c is nevative means right and c is positive means left. Then we have b = -2 which flips the graph horizontally first then compresses by a factor of 2. Again, absolute value of b more than 1 means compress and less than 1 means stretch. Next is a which is 1 so, no change. Then d is negative 1 so shift down by one unit. Aand that's the final graph. Let's wrap this one up right here. Next, i'll talk about piecewise functions and composite functions.
